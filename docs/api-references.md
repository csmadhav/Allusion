## Setup options

While calling `init` or importing standalone build of Allusion JS make sure you have properly configured setup options.

|:------------:|:---------:|-------------|----------|
|`trackingUrl` | `string`  | Endpoint to push [payload](#payload) to, this should to any logging and alert management platforms like ELK, splunk, cloudwatch or your company's inhouse solution. Request method to this URL would be `POST`| `true` |

|`globalUserID` | `string`  | Allusion assigns user an ID and saves it in form of cookie, when user returns the webpage, we identify its the same user using cookie value. |
|`globalVisitID` | `string`  | Allusion assigns each user's visit an ID. You can search your logs using this ID. You may get multiple entries in your log for the same visit ID since Allusion will send this payload for each error. Each payload will contain event details (like click, XHR sent and all) occured before the error. Once and event is sent it wont be sent again. Number of payloads sent from the page would be equal to the errors encountered on the page. |
